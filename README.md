# Berlin School of Economics (BSE) poster (A0-A4)
This project provides a Latex poster for the Berlin School of Economics based on the "baposter"-style with slight changes.
The basic poster is in A0. It is easily scalable by changing the options in the documentclass (see poster_a0.tex for further details).

For style changes have a look into "baposter" guides like this one from the author Brian Amberg.
